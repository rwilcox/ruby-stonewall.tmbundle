Introduction
======================

This is a bundle for David Bock's [Stonewall](https://github.com/bokmann/stonewall) gem.

Right now it's composed on a language grammar that shows all action declarations in the function popup.
Action blocks are a relatively new part of Stonewall.

Eventually I'll add some other things to the bundle, as I need them
